# buzz wire game

## Summary

I am going to build a buzz wire game
Buzz wire is a challenging and competitive game. The object of the game is to carefully move the wire wand loop along the copper wire “maze” without touching it.
When the loop touches the wire, you will hear a “BUZZ”. The goal is to be fast and at the same time to be efficient, having the least amount of touches.
I am excited to build it because This project can serve as an introduction to circuits for teenagers from approximately 14-16 years old. 
It involves the creation of a buzzer game. During the construction, learners develop basic knowledge of electrical circuits, base level engineering, sensors and design.
If you like puzzles, this whole project is a series of puzzles. But none of the parts are impossible, so get into it with confidence!
It is a perfect engaging learning activity that is so much fun that it will feel like a hooby
## Plan
step 1 The materials
step 2 Make the Frame & Maze 
step 3 Make the Circuit 
step 4 Design Your Loop Wand
step 5 Make All the Connections  
- Aluminium Composite,3 * straws
- Switch on/of, Buzzer
- Led 3v, resistor 500π
- Wire electric, fine wire
- 9V battery and battery connector
- Card board sheet, Hot Gule with glue gun 
first I will fold the electric wire and join the wire(to make them conduct the electricity)  and put at the two ends by the sticky tape and 
mamake the base of the project by a card bord and the straws, secondly wire with the battery and make something like a pen (which the cover of the pen is bad condutor
of electricity so it is safe),third make all the connections with the remaining from (that is the link of the video https://youtu.be/ATXhXl1KNCU)
## Budget
- Aluminium Composite,3 * straws
- Switch on/of, Buzzer
